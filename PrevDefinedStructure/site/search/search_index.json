Business Use Case Narrative Let's take a scenario where we need to push service update seamlessly without impacting existing users. If we have some service which exposed as API to outside and there are active users for that API we cannot simply push changes to that API as it breaks existing clients. When API creator created updated version of same existing API(version 1.0.0) he can create new version(version 1.1.0) of API. This new API can have few additional resources than the original API(which is version 1.0.0). If any new user need to use newly added API resources that user need to use 1.1.0 version of the API. Persona API Publisher - API publisher is main role which is responsible for managing APIs API Creator - API creator responsible for create and modify APIs according changes we are suppose to rollout. Sub Scenarios When it comes to API versining there can be muliple users associated with that story. If we take this particular example API publisher will perform all API creating, versioning, create new version, manage lifecycles of existing APIs. Then API subscriber will be able see those actions perform by API publisher. For an example if publisher created new version (1.1.0) of exsting API version (1.0.0) then subscriber will see this new version and should be able to test it and subscribe. And with subscriber notification feature API publisher can notify all users of existing version 1.0.0. 1.1 Use API versioning to rollout API updates and changes. API Reference Users can create a new API version of API via publisher user interface or REST API. Following is the base URL of API copy resource. Users can invoke this API and create copy of existing API with different version.

Sample use case To address this requirement first step we need to follow is create copy of existing API. Then user can add any additional details that we need to add here for modified API. Once API creator done with expected changes API can publish. So it will apppear in API store and users will be able to use that. Prerequisites A REST client or cURL to invoke API. Or user can use API publisher web application to test entire flow. Development Start the wso2am-2.6.0 distribution by executing [APIM_HOME]/bin/wso2server.sh or [APIM_HOME]/bin/wso2server.bat Then user will need to login to API publisher as API creator. Once logged in user will need to create API(Mobile_Stock_API). Initial version of this API can be version 1.0.0. After creating this API, API publisher need to login to API publisher UI and publish newly created API. Now once API subscriber logged in to API store(Developer console) that user should be able to see newly created API.

API with initial version(which is 1.0.0) should be in published state while newly created API is in created state. Once user published newly created version both APIs should appear in API.

Supported versions All Pre-requisites User can use API publisher web application to implement entire flow Development guidelines Start wso2am-2.6.0 distribution by executing [APIM_HOME]/bin/wso2server.sh or [APIM_HOME]/bin/wso2server.bat Then user will need to login to API publisher as API creator.

Sample use case An API developer wants to expose an API via an inline script for the purpose of early promotion and testing. To do that developer would go to the API publisher and create a Prototype REST or WebSocket API by entering API name, version, context, and at least one resource, and provide a inline script to mock the API backend.
